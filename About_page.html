        <p>

        Bill Gates is a technologist, business leader, and philanthropist. He grew up in Seattle, Washington, with an amazing
        and supportive family who encouraged his interest in computers at an early age. He dropped out of college to start
        Microsoft with his childhood friend Paul Allen. He married Melinda French in 1994 and they have three children. Today,
        Bill and Melinda Gates co-chair the charitable foundation bearing their names and are working together to give their
        wealth back to society.
        
        Bill grew up in Seattle with his two sisters. His dad, William H. Gates II, is a Seattle attorney and one of the
        co-chairs of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. His late mother, Mary Gates, was a schoolteacher, University of
        Washington regent, and chairwoman of United Way International.

        </p>
        
        <p>
            All that changed in December 1974, when Allen showed Gates a magazine article about the world's first microcomputer,
            the
            Altair 8800. Seeing an opportunity, Gates and Allen called the manufacturer, MITS, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and
            told
            the president they had written a version of the popular computer language BASIC for the Altair. When he said he'd
            like
            to see it, Gates and Allen, who actually hadn't written anything, starting working day and night in Harvard's
            computer
            lab. Because they did not have an Altair to work on, they were forced to simulate it on other computers. When Allen
            flew
            to Albuquerque to test the program on the Altair, neither he nor Gates was sure it would run. But run it did. Gates
            dropped out of Harvard and moved with Allen to Albuquerque, where they officially established Microsoft. MITS
            collapsed
            shortly thereafter, but Gates and Allen were already writing software for other computer start-ups including
            Commodore,
            Apple and Tandy Corp.
        </p>
        <p>
            The duo moved the company to Seattle in 1979, and that's when Microsoft hit the big time. When Gates learned IBM was
            having trouble obtaining an operating system for its new PC, he bought an existing operating system from a small
            Seattle
            company for $50,000, developed it into MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System), then licensed it to IBM. The genius
            of
            the IBM deal, masterminded by Gates, was that while IBM got MS-DOS, Microsoft retained the right to license it to
            other
            computer makers.

            </li>
            <li>
                Like many other successful tech entrepreneurs, Gates was a college dropout. He left Harvard University in 1975 to fully
                devote himself to Microsoft.

                Two years after he dropped out of Harvard, Gates was arrested in New Mexico. He was driving without a license and ran a
                red light.
            </li>
            <li>
                At Microsoft, Gates used to memorize employees' license plates to keep tabs on their comings and goings. "Eventually I
                had to loosen up, as the company got to a reasonable size," he said.
            </li>
            <li>
                Speaking of cars, Gates has quite the Porsche collection. The headliner is his Porsche 959 sports car, which he bought
                13 years before the car was approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency or the US Department of Transportation.
            </li>
            <li>
                For air travel, Gates used to fly coach. Nowadays he gets around in the plane he's owned since 1997, which he calls his
                "big splurge.

            <li>
                Despite his immense wealth, Gates says his kids will only inherit $10 million each â€” just a fraction of his $90.9
                billion net worth. "Leaving kids massive amounts of money is not a favor to them," he says
            </li>
            <li>
                Gates says if Microsoft hadn't worked out, he probably would've been a researcher for artificial intelligence.
            </li>
            <li>
                Despite his interest in AI, Gates says he is "in the camp that is concerned about super intelligence." That camp also
                includes notable leaders in science in technology, like Elon Musk and the late Stephen Hawking
